This project is a fork of the github.com/leaf-ai/go-service project.

This document describes a number of components exported by this package that are intended for use in the implementation of services within a service mesh or deployed using a managed platform.

This document is aimed at an audience with development and deployment skills who desire to implement services using the Go computer language.

The Go Service Components (GSC) are currently used within the Cognizant LEAF environment and its associated StudioML compute platform.
